# IFLS
The Indonesia Family Life Survey is a longitudinal survey on Indonesian households conducted by RAND Corporation. The data is publicly available from their website: https://www.rand.org/labor/FLS/IFLS/access.html

I have generated various variables for different research projects in microeconomics for development from the IFLS data. In this repository, I will share the Stata do-file and notes to help you replicate the generation process for your own research need. Note that the data can be on an individual level, household level, or community level. Details on how to merge the datasets on different level will be explained on the notes. I will update this repository periodically.
