# IFLS
The Indonesia Family Life Survey is a longitudinal survey on Indonesian households conducted by RAND Corporation. The data is publicly available from their website: https://www.rand.org/labor/FLS/IFLS/access.html

I have generated various variables for different research projects in microeconomics for development from the IFLS data. In this repository, I will share the Stata do-file and notes to help you replicate the generation process for your own research need. I will update this repository periodically.
